The two teams compete, each giving a word of advice that can point to many words on the 'spymaster' board. Other players on the team try to guess the words of their team while avoiding the words of the other team.",

One tip can be related to many words on the table. Field workers are trying to guess what the spy leader was saying. When a field worker touches a word, the spymaster reveals his hidden identity. If field workers guess correctly, they can continue to guess for a given tip until they run out of ideas or hit the wrong person. Then it's the other team's turn to give a hint and guess. The first team to contact all the agents wins the game.",
